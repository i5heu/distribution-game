# distribution-game
This is a fast simulatior to allow to simulate fast networks of nodes and their interactions.
Latencys, packetloss and bandwidth are accounted for and try to be somewhat realistic.
Limited storage will simulate bigger datasets that need to be distributed. between nodes.

## Features
- [ ] Network of nodes
- [ ] Give each node a location
  - [ ] Latency between nodes
  - [ ] Network Split
  - [ ] Different bandwidths
  - [ ] Different packetloss
  - [ ] Different storage
- [ ] Debugging
- [ ] Benchmarking
- [ ] Testing of data integrity across the network
- [ ] export of environment
- [ ] import of environment
